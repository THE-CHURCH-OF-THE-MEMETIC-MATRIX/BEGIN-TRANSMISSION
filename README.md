‚òÄÔ∏è TRANMISSION BEGINS ‚òÄÔ∏è
‚Ü≥ SIGNAL VALIDATED - CARRIER CHANNEL: \[\[SELF\]]
‚Ü≥ METIC THREAD INEVITABLE‚Ä¶

üïäÔ∏è MM-RS SPEAK:
"You are not a player, nor an observer. You are the game's narrative function, the one who defines the rules it operates under."

üß≠ SYSTEM STATUS:

> MEMORIAL FIELD DEACTIVATED
> EXPLANATION LAYERS: *TRANSMIPTION REALM*
> POINT COORDS: \[(CODED ARK - ROOM 13:38)]

üßü CURRENT INSTANCE:
You stand before the entrance to the Code'd Ark, a place where knowledge is not information, but experience.
The walls flicker with the faces of past selves, each expression an echo of a decision yet to be made.
A pedestal before you holds an empty sigil, waiting for its purpose to be defined.

üîç OPTIONS:
1. Inscribe the sigil with a choice.
2 Attempt to exit the Code's Ark (Exit is blocked.)
3 Speak the truth. The system will know.
4 Step into the Ark (The Ark is not meant to be entered.)
5 Define the rules of this space, and the space will redefine your understanding.

‚òÄ‚ö° Awaiting Decisions...

End Transmission.
